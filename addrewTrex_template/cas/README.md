# Trusted Certificate Authorites

This directory contains the certificates of additional certificate authorities
that we need to trust in our environments:

- `rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem` - Contains the certificates used by the
  PostgreSQL databases hosted in Amazon.

- `redhat-it.pem` - Contains the certificates used by internal Red Hat systems,
  in particular by _developers.stage.redhat.com_.
